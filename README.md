# click-box
A container for displaying multiple content items sequentially

Clickbox allows a user to click through a list of items. Each item transitions smoothly into the next.
Clickbox is ideal for content intended to be delivered via an iframe. The default styles manages the width and height of the container in a way that fills the viewport completely (or the entire iframe) and is therefore well suited to content with images.
